# VS Code Tasks Update - Directory Navigation Enhancement

## Summary
Updated all VS Code tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json` to be robust and work correctly regardless of the current working directory when the task is executed.

## Changes Made

### Enhanced Directory Navigation Logic
All tasks that need to work in the `frontend` directory now use this pattern:

```powershell
if ((Get-Location).Path -notlike '*frontend') {
  if (Test-Path 'frontend') {
    Set-Location frontend
    Write-Host 'Navigated to frontend directory' -ForegroundColor Yellow
  } else {
    Write-Host 'Frontend directory not found in current location' -ForegroundColor Red
    exit 1
  }
} else {
  Write-Host 'Already in frontend directory' -ForegroundColor Green
}
```

### Updated Tasks
1. **Check Version Configuration** - Enhanced with robust directory navigation
2. **Switch to Svelte 4** - Enhanced with robust directory navigation  
3. **Switch to Svelte 5** - Enhanced with robust directory navigation
4. **Dev Server (Auto-detect Version)** - Enhanced with robust directory navigation
5. **Build (Current Version)** - Enhanced with robust directory navigation
6. **Install Dependencies** - Enhanced with robust directory navigation

### Added `cwd` Options
All tasks that require workspace context now include:
```json
"options": {
  "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
}
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Works from workspace root
When terminal starts in `c:\UserFiles\Github\TimelessJewelGenerator\timeless-jewels_Partial\`, tasks will:
- Detect they're not in frontend directory
- Find the `frontend` subdirectory
- Navigate to it automatically
- Execute the intended commands

### ✅ Works from frontend directory
When terminal starts in `c:\UserFiles\Github\TimelessJewelGenerator\timeless-jewels_Partial\frontend\`, tasks will:
- Detect they're already in the frontend directory
- Skip navigation
- Execute the intended commands immediately

### ✅ Error handling
If tasks are run from an unexpected location:
- They'll provide clear error messages
- Exit cleanly with error code 1
- Prevent command execution in wrong directory

## Testing Results

✅ Directory detection logic tested and working  
✅ Navigation from workspace root → frontend: SUCCESS  
✅ Skip navigation when already in frontend: SUCCESS  
✅ Error handling for missing frontend directory: SUCCESS  
✅ All tasks maintain existing functionality while adding robustness

## VS Code Task Compatibility

The tasks now work correctly with:
- Single terminal instances that persist directory changes
- Multiple terminal instances 
- Tasks run from Command Palette
- Tasks run from Terminal menu
- Background and foreground task execution

This enhancement resolves the directory navigation issues and makes the development workflow more reliable regardless of VS Code terminal settings.
