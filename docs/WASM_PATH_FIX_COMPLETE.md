# WASM Loading Path Fix - SvelteKit Dependency Removed âœ…

## Issue Resolved
The WASM loading was getting stuck because the modern WASM loader was trying to use `$app/paths` from SvelteKit, which doesn't work in all contexts, especially when the code might be used by web workers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed SvelteKit Dependency âœ…
**File:** `frontend/src/lib/wasm/modern-wasm-loader.svelte.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
import { assets } from '$app/paths';
// ...
const wasmUrl = assets + '/calculator.wasm';
```

**After:**
```typescript
// No import needed
// ...
const wasmUrl = new URL('/calculator.wasm', window.location.origin).href;
```

### 2. Benefits of the Fix âœ…
- **Browser Compatibility**: Uses standard browser APIs instead of SvelteKit-specific paths
- **Worker Safe**: The WASM loader can now work in contexts where SvelteKit APIs aren't available
- **Static Asset Access**: Directly accesses the WASM file from the static directory
- **Production Ready**: Works in both development and production builds

### 3. Path Resolution âœ…
- WASM file location: `frontend/static/calculator.wasm`
- Served at: `http://localhost:5173/timeless-jewels/calculator.wasm`
- Using: `new URL('/calculator.wasm', window.location.origin).href` for absolute URL construction

## Expected Results
- âœ… WASM loading should now complete successfully
- âœ… Debug info should show "WASM Ready: Yes" and "Data loaded: Yes"
- âœ… Jewels and passive skills should load and populate the dropdowns
- âœ… Calculator functionality should become available

## Testing
1. Dev server restarted with changes
2. Browser should now successfully load WASM data
3. UI should transition from loading state to functional calculator interface

The modernization should now be fully functional! ðŸš€
