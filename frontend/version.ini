# Timeless Jewel Generator - Version Configuration
# This file controls which Svelte version to use for development and builds
# Default: Svelte 5 (modern syntax with runes and improved reactivity)

[svelte]
# Version can be: 4 or 5
# Default: 5 (for latest features and performance improvements)
version = 5

# Package configuration
# svelte5_package: Modern package.json with Svelte 5 dependencies
# svelte4_package: LegacyPackage.json with Svelte 4 dependencies  
[packages]
svelte5_package = Svelte5Package.json

# Auto-switching options
[options]
# auto_install: Automatically run pnpm install after package switching
auto_install = true

# respect_current_mode: When true, prevents switching away from current mode during testing
# This avoids unnecessary package reinstalls when testing the current Svelte version
respect_current_mode = true

# skip_version_validation: When true, skips checking if current packages match target version
# Useful when you want to avoid automatic package switching during development
skip_version_validation = false

# testing_mode: When true, prevents any version switching during testing operations
# Ensures tests run against the currently configured version only
testing_mode = false

# backup_current: Create backup of current package.json before switching

# Component loading strategy
[components]
# Strategy can be: dynamic (runtime detection) or static (build-time)
# Default: dynamic (supports runtime version switching)

# Fallback behavior when version detection fails
